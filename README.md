# Ninjacart-Vegetable-Image-Classification
Ninjacart Vegetable Image Classification using Computer Vision &amp; Deep Learning

- Developed a multi-class image classification system to identify vegetables (onion, potato, tomato) and filter non-vegetable market images as noise.
- Worked with web-scraped image datasets and implemented data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Trained and evaluated classification models using confusion matrices and performance metrics to ensure accurate labeling.
- Demonstrated applicability of machine learning models in real-world supply chain automation and quality control scenarios.
- Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn,Computer Vison
